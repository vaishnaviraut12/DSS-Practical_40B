In data science using Python, I worked with Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook 📝. I used libraries like Pandas for data manipulation 🧹, NumPy for numerical calculations 🔢, and Matplotlib for visualizing data with charts and graphs 📊.

For machine learning, I explored and applied various algorithms 🤖, including:

Simple Linear Regression: Predicting continuous outcomes based on a single variable 📈.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifying data points by their proximity 👥.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Identifying the best boundary to separate data into distinct classes 🧠.


These libraries and algorithms allowed me to process, visualize, and develop smart models 🚀!
